This project contains two Python files:

task1.py: A program which helps us to calculate the factorial of the number using a function

-->In this task-1 i have taken an integer input from the user.
-->i have then created a user defined function with name factorial() in which i am passing the argument same as the calling function.
-->i have also created a local variable fact=1
-->through the if-else conditional statements i have made sure that if someone enters 0 as a value the return statement always gives result as 1.
-->then using for loop i have calculated the factorial of the given input and using return statement it prints the value iterated in for loop
--> then at last i have called the factorial() and passed the argument as provided by the user




task2.py: A simple program that uses math module for calculations

-->in this task-2 i have imported the predefined math modules for easier calculations
--> then i have taken an float value from the user so it can support even decimals calculations
-->rather than creating new variables and wasting storage, i have directly used the math module functions in the print statement  
--> predefined functions for square root was -- sqrt() , logarithm was log() and sine was sin() where num variable was passed as argument
